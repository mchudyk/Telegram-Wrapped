IT'S THE IMAGINARY CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE

December 28th:
Person A: Hey👋! Just got home from the gym. How's your day going?
Person B: Pretty busy. Still at work, wrapping up a project. You know, the one for our international client.
Person A: Oh yeah, the one with the tight deadline? Must be stressful with everything happening in the world right now, especially with the ongoing global economic shifts.
Person B: Tell me about it. And with the current political tensions in Europe, it's been a challenge coordinating with our partners there.
Person A: Speaking of which, did you hear about the recent summit? Seems like there might be some positive developments.
Person B: Yeah, I caught a bit on the news during lunch. Fingers crossed it leads to something good. By the way, how's your sister doing in London with all this?
Person A: She's managing. Says the city's a bit on edge, but she's keeping safe. Changed her commute to avoid the crowded areas.
Person B: Smart move. Oh, and I meant to ask, did you decide on your vacation plans? Still thinking of Japan?
Person A: Definitely leaning towards Japan. But with the current travel restrictions, I'm waiting a bit before booking anything.
Person B: Makes sense. Hey, I have to jump into another meeting. Let's catch up later?
Person A: Sure thing 😉. Good luck with the meeting. Talk soon!


December 29th:
Person B: Morning👋! Just sent you a photo of the new office layout. What do you think?
Person A: [Sent a photo] Looks great 🔥! Very modern. Here's a pic of the Japanese garden I told you about. Still dreaming of that trip.
Person B: Beautiful! Definitely a must-visit. How was your day? You mentioned hitting the gym again today.
Person A: Yeah, had a good workout. But the gym was packed! Seems everyone's trying to stay fit despite the hectic world news.
Person B: No kidding. Speaking of news, did you see the latest update about the tech conference? They're shifting it online due to the travel issues.
Person A: Saw that. Makes sense. I'm attending a webinar on computational science later. Thought it might be useful for our project.
Person B: Good call. [Sent an audio] Here's a quick update on the project status 😁.
Person A: Thanks for the audio. I'll give it a listen during lunch. Oh, and my sister called last night – says London's feeling more relaxed now.
Person B: That's good to hear. Relief for you too, I bet. Alright, I've got to head into a meeting. Let's catch up in the evening?
Person A: Sure thing. Have a good one 🤍!
